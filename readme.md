## What I learn

For the most part, my biggest challenge was coming up with the design. I thought of the user experience and the user persona for this platform. I gave it a more modern look and dark theme. 

My favorite aspect of this project was designing all the patterns on Canva and seeing how everything came together.

Additionally, I learn you can have more than one background value on a background-image property in CSS.

### Code I'm proud of

<code>
.app {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  padding: 0 104px;
  align-items: center;
  color: var(--white);
  text-shadow: 0 0 1px var(--black);
  background: var(--gray) url(./assets/design-3-box.svg) no-repeat left 338px top;
  box-shadow: rgba(96, 96, 98, 0.379) 0px 2px 5px -1px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3) 0px 1px 3px -1px;
}</code>


## Deployment
I deployed by website by using [CodeSandBox](https://ypchsi-5500.csb.app/)
